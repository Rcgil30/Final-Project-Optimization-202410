## Dataset selection

The dataset we selected for this project is the California Housing Prices Data, which can be found in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features/code).

The reason we selected this dataset is because it has a great variety of variables that we can work with, making it a great tool for learning predictive machine learning algorithms. Also, this could have applications in real life scenarios, for example, building companies could benefit of a model that could predict the value of a house given the variables, using this to evaluate the potential profitability of a building. This could also be used by potential home buyers to estimate a price for a house given the characteristics that they want in that house.

## Visualization and statistical insights

Based on our dataset, we got the following graphics:


With this, we concluded that...
